"""function for concatinating two 2d matrices along a given axis"""


def cat_matrices2D(mat1, mat2, axis=0):
    """
    Concatenates two 2D matrices along a specified axis.

    Parameters:
        mat1 (list of list of int/float): The first matrix.
        mat2 (list of list of int/float): The second matrix.
        axis (int): The axis along which to concatenate (0 for rows, 1 for
columns).

    Returns:
        list of list of int/float: A new matrix resulting from concatenation.
        If the matrices cannot be concatenated along the specified axis,
returns None.

    Assumptions:
        - mat1 and mat2 are 2D matrices (lists of lists) with uniform row
lengths.
        - All elements are integers or floats.
