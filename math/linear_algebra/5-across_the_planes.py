    Adds two 2D matrices element-wise.

    Parameters:
        mat1 (list of list of int/float): The first matrix.
        mat2 (list of list of int/float): The second matrix.

    Returns:
        list of list of int/float: A new matrix representing the element-wise
sum of mat1 and mat2.
        If mat1 and mat2 do not have the same shape, returns None.

    Assumptions:
        - mat1 and mat2 are 2D matrices with consistent row and column lengths.
        - All elements are either integers or floats.
